title: 'I like speaking, but I lack the confidence'

---


I recently went to a .NET meetup in my area to present the [MVVM Light][mvvm-light] framework in the context of Universal Windows Platform. You can find the presentation [here][presentation]. After a few introduction points and went into the code, and I've chosen to use the [Podcast Manager][solocast] I'm working on. This when the stage fright kicked in. No matter how much I know the code, I can't speak confidenly enough. I stutter, have a low voice and gennerally insecurity.

I want to get rid of this problem, but I really don't know how. I'd like to create a [YouTube Channel][channel] filled with C# and .NET Tutorials, but since I've released my [first video][1st-video], I'm too scared to talk into the mic again.

I really don't know what to do. If you guys have any tips on how to beat this, please leave them in the comments below.
